    "The file `daily_weather.csv` is a comma-separated file that contains weather data.  This data comes from a weather station located in San Diego, California.  The weather station is equipped with sensors that capture weather-related measurements such as air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity.  Data was collected for a period of three years, from September 2011 to September 2014, to ensure that sufficient data for different seasons and weather conditions is captured.\r\n",

    "Sensor measurements from the weather station were captured at one-minute intervals.  These measurements were then processed to generate values to describe daily weather. Since this dataset was created to classify low-humidity days vs. non-low-humidity days (that is, days with normal or high humidity), the variables included are weather measurements in the morning, with one measurement, namely relatively humidity, in the afternooy.\r\n",
